      <p>Looking to fight, smoking a blunt and a pipe.</p>
      <p>Taking a bite, worm in the apple.<br>
      I knew what would happen,<br> 'cause honey the vermin survive.
      <p>Swerve to the side, been driving all night.</p>

      I'm just looking for something to soften the blow.</p>
      <p>A second inside of the truth.</p>
